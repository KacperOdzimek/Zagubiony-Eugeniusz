Not very working, unreal engine 4, pixel art strategy game, created in less than 24 hours, for ,,TutJam" game jam.

The game has a lot of bugs, as the isometry was implemented in wrong way. I have moved tile's and character's geometry, istead of offseting pixels on gpu, so raycasting sometimes doesn't work like it should.
